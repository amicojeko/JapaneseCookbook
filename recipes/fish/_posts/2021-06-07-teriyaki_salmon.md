## Preparazione

Season the salmon with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Lightly coat the salmon with all-purpose flour. Heat the cooking oil or butter in the frying pan and cook the salmon one side for 3 minutes. Once nicely brown, flip the salmon. Add 1 Tbsp sake and cover to cook for 3 minutes. Remove the lid and pour the Teriyaki Sauce. Spoon the sauce over the salmon to coat well.
